# quad-gy80
Quadcopter implementation using a gy-80 IMU

## Intro
This is the implementation of a quadcopter created using the parts listed below:
* Arduino MEGA 2560
* GY-80 10DOF IMU
* Xbee Pro 900 MHz RPSMA
* Xbee Arduino Shield

This repository will primarily serve to manage the code associated with balancing the quadcopter, but some code for remote control may be included. A custom library will be created for using the GY-80, but otherwise all libraries will be regular arduino libraries commonly found elsewhere or included with the IDE. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is purely to serve the author's curiousity and education of microcontrollers and embedded systems.
